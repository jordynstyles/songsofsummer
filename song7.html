        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>While “Espresso” ended up being the bigger hit off of Sabrina Carpenter’s latest LP Short and Sweet, “Please Please Please” is undoubtedly the better song. It’s a slower pop ballad with a bit of a country twang while managing to showcase Sabrina’s distinct humor through the lyrics. Because the producer Jack Antanoff has been criticized for his unoriginal and monotonous production as of late, I was a bit worried about how this song would turn out. But while I wouldn’t call the instrumental of this song novel, it’s cute, ethereal, and enjoyable while it’s on.</p>
