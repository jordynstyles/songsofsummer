        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>“I Had Some Help” is a country pop hit by singer and rapper Post Malone featuring country singer Morgan Wallen that, honestly, doesn’t leave much of an impression. Admittedly, its lyrics, which depict a relationship torn apart by alcoholism, are a bit darker than one might expect considering the upbeat pop instrumentation they’re paired with. That said, I don’t think this song deviates from the rest of its genre in an interesting way, nor is it an especially interesting song to begin with. This is not an exceptionally bad song per se, it's just unexceptional. Turn on any radio station that plays pop country music and I’m sure you’ll find something that accomplishes exactly what this one does better.</p>
