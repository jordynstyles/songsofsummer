        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>Irish singer-songwriter Hozier released the EP Unheard earlier this year, a collection of four songs that were taken off of his 2023 LP Unreal Unearth. Ironically, the song “Too Sweet” from the EP would become the most popular song of this album cycle, and Hozier’s second most streamed song overall. “Too Sweet” depicts the story of two individuals, one who loves to drink and stay out late, and the other whose lifestyle is quite the opposite. This difference between them may be detrimental to the relationship’s survival. I really like this song. While I don’t listen to Hozier’s music regularly, when I happen to come across a new song by him, I can always count on it having strong lyrics and vocal performances. “Too Sweet” is no exception.</p>
