        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>While I would only consider myself a casual hip-hop fan, I was completely enraptured by the Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef that “Not Like Us” that took place from March to May earlier this year. After the release of Lamar’s “Meet the Grahams,” a dark, haunting song that I rarely find myself revisiting, “Not Like Us” felt like a welcome–and deserved–victory lap. Four months later, this song is still in my regular rotation. From its boisterous beat to its lively brass instrumentation and a plethora of memorable, funny, and cutting lyrics from Kendrick Lamar, “Not Like Us” is undoubtedly my song of the summer.</p>
