        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>Billie Eilish is an artist I’ve listened to and admired for years, and though Hit Me Hard and Soft is not my favorite of her three albums, I do still find it enjoyable. Compared to the much darker, grittier content that Billie Eilish was known for on her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? The hit single from this new album “Birds of a Feather” perfectly depicts how much Eilish’s music has changed in the last few years. “Birds of a Feather” is a cute song with a beautiful vocal melody and instrumental produced by Eilish’s brother Finneas, but I find that the lyrics are cliche and unremarkable. So while I do listen to this song fairly regularly, I believe that the LP has songs with more to offer than this one.</p>
