        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>While there are songs on this list that I prefer over Espresso, including another song by Sabrina Carpenter, if asked, I’d have to say that Espresso was the song of the summer. It felt impossible to escape from this song in the several weeks after it was first released. Luckily for me and everyone else exposed to it, it’s a pretty good song. It has silly lyrics with tons of innuendos, a fun, poppy instrumental, and an earworm chorus. This song manages to capture the feeling of summer in a way the others don’t, and for that, Sabrina deserves all the success this song has garnered. </p>
