        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>Looking at only the first two songs on this list, you’d think Billboard was ranking the best 2024 country releases about getting drunk, but surprisingly that is not the case. While Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” has a very similar “thesis” to its predecessor, I do find this one more interesting to listen to. It’s a short song with simple guitar and violin instrumentation and a catchy chorus. With the inclusion of background claps, I can easily picture people dancing to this song at a party and enjoying themselves. It's not one I envision myself revisiting, but it's nice enough while it's on.</p>
