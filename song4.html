        <h3>My Review</h3>
        <p>“Million Dollar Baby” is a fun, catchy R&B and electro-funk song by Tommy Richman. Clocking in at a mere two minutes and thirty-five seconds, “Million Dollar Baby” is—much like another artist we’ll be discussing—short and sweet. With a thumping bassline and ear-worm melody, it’s impossible to listen to this song and not find yourself humming it for the rest of the day.
